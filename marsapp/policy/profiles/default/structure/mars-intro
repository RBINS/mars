<p style="text-align: justify;"> The Belgian archaeological collections are most of the time scattered among various federal institutions (FSEs) but also community, regional, communal or even private institutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The digitization of the &quot;archaeological&quot; collections is essential, because of their unique and irreplaceable character. Likewise, the creation of coherent virtual sets is the only realistic means to regroup collections which are scattered, allowing thus a better patrimonial and scientific management.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The aim of this project is the testing of the common digitization of the archaeological collections of the 3 FSEs, with a special concern for synergy and efficiency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Already during the first phase of the project, operators in the archaeological world outside the FSEs (universities, regions, associations, foreign institutions) will be integrated in the development of the project through their participation in the follow-up committee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">  During the second phase, the pilot application will be extended to new partners wishing to use MARS for their own collections.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> From a technological point of view, MARS will be set up using &quot;open source&quot; technologies, in order to guarantee its durability and its development independently from any commercial constraint. This option will also benefit the transfer of the technology developed in other fields than archaeology.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">             </div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> We will stress the flexibility of the system and its multi-lingual aspects as well at the level of the encoding of data as at the level of consulting them.</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">             </div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> The multi-media systems accepted will enable the filing and showing of documents, sounds, videos, pictures, animations in 3 dimensional (3D) models.</p>
